## Overview

This repository introduces a new theoretical framework called **Dimensional Evolution**, which reinterprets the foundations of quantum physics through the lens of **resonant observation**. It proposes that what we perceive as wavefunction collapse is not an actual collapse—but rather a **filtering of waveform reality** based on the observer’s resonance with energy.

At its core, this theory suggests:

- The human body functions as a **fractal antenna**, only perceiving frequencies it can resonate with.
- Observation does **not collapse reality**, but aligns with a slice of it—creating the illusion of collapse.
- **We are the interference pattern** seen in the double slit experiment.
- Evolution, memory, perception, and even consciousness are emergent results of **resonant entropy** and energy seeking equilibrium.
- Phenomena such as **gravity, dark matter, and dark energy** can be reinterpreted as layers of energy out of resonance with our current state.
