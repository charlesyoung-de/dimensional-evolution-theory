# Dimensional Evolution Theory

**Author:** Charles Francis Young (Chuck)  
**Last Updated:** May 2025  

---

## 📘 Overview

**Dimensional Evolution** is a new unified theory proposing that all physical phenomena—including gravity, consciousness, biology, and quantum mechanics—are expressions of **fractal resonance** between observed and unobserved waveforms. This repository contains the full illustrated manuscript, diagrams, and supporting documents for Version 1.0 of the theory.

The theory frames observation not as collapse, but as **resonant selection**. The observer does not see “the universe”—they **tune into it**. And what they tune into is a fractal echo of themselves.

## 🌌 Core Concepts

- **YouVerse and YouInverse:** Each observer creates a resonant slice of reality between observed and unobserved dimensions.
- **Dimensional Gravity:** Gravity emerges as tension between inverse fields, not curvature of spacetime.
- **Magnetic Fields:** Interference patterns from entangled inverses—measurable reflections of consciousness.
- **Electron as Event Horizon:** Electrons behave as micro black holes, fractally mirroring cosmic phenomena.
- **Biological Resonance:** DNA, heartbeat, and perception are antenna functions of a harmonic energy system.

## 🧪 Experimental Pathways (In Progress)

This version includes theoretical support for field-based experiments, including:
- Capacitor bounce-back and energy retention beyond Ohmic models
- Spark gap and field rebound studies
- Inverse-field detection using low-resistance resonant circuits

Further bench experiments will be logged in future versions.
